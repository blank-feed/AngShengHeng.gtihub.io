                Plastic (or polyester) coverstocks are the smoothest and the least reactive surface type on bowling balls. 
                <br>
                <br>
                They tend to not hook or hook a little bit at most and can go directly from the foul line straight to the pins.
                <br>
                <br>
                They are best used for sparing, hence most commonly found on spare balls.

                Urethane surfaces are a step up from plastic coverstocks. 
                <br>
                <br>
                They usually react the earliest amongst all surfaces and hook a few boards more than a plastic would.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bowlers prefer using urethane balls when the lanes are either beaten down or the pattern is a short one.

                There are 3 types of reactive coverstocks and solid is one of them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Solid reactive coverstocks reacts the earliest out of all 3 types and they absorb the oil the fastest.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bowlers typically use it on fresh patterns or heavy volume patterns.

                Hybrid balls react slightly later than pearl balls but still skid across the lane more than a solid would usually.

                They can be used on a variety of lane conditions as they are quite flexible.

                Bowlers tend to lean towards pearl balls once the lane begins to break down as they need the length in their balls.
