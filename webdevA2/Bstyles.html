                One handed bowling is the most common style to play bowling. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is also the most traditional style as professional bowling started with only one handed bowlers.
                <br>
                <br>
                The style consist of the bowler using their dominant hand to hold their ball using their thumb, middle and ring finger 
                 and their other non-dominant hand to use as the balance hand.
                <br>
                <br>
                Professional bowlers who throw one handed are : Chris Barnes, EJ Tackett, Tommy Jones and more.

                Two handed bowling style is the upcoming norm in bowling.
                <br>
                <br>
                This style was first seen by Jason Belmonte and Osku Palermaa and has proven to have advantages over the usual 
                one handed bowling style. 
                <br>
                <br>
                By using 2 hands, the bowler can keep their dominant hand underneath the ball and hence can generate more revolutions 
                than typical one handed bowlers.
