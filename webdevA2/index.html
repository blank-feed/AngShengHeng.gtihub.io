                Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in which a player rolls a ball toward pins.
                <br>
                <br>
                In bowling, the goal is to knock over as many pins as possible over the lane which is covered in oil.
                <br>
                <br>
                A strike is achieved when all 10 pins are knocked over on the first shot,
                <br>
                whereas a spare is achieved if all 10 pins are knocked over on the second shot.

            A bowling game consists of 10 frames. Each player can throw up to 2 shots every frame.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the 10th frame (last frame), if the player gets a strike, the player gets 2 extra shots. Whereas if the player
            gets a spare, the player would get 1 extra shot instead.
            <br>
            <br>
            A strike would give a total score of 10 plus a bonus of the next 2 shots. 
            <br>
            A spare would give a total score of 10 plus a bonus of the next shot.
            <br>
            <br>
            The maximum score a player can get without handicap is 300.
